## Creating an Issue on GitHub
---

- Issues are used to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests in a repository. Here's how to create one:

---

- Navigate to the Repository: Go to the repository where you want to create the issue.

---

- Click on the "Issues" Tab: On the repository's main page, click the "Issues" tab located above the file list (usually near "Pull requests" and "Actions").

---

- Click "New Issue": Click the green "New issue" button on the right side.

---

- Title and Description: Add a descriptive title and a detailed explanation in the comment section. You can use markdown formatting to organize the information or provide more clarity (e.g., adding bullet points or headers).

---

-  Optional Labels, Assignees, and Milestones: You can assign people to work on the issue (assignees), categorize it using labels (like "bug," "enhancement," etc.), or link it to specific milestones.

---

## Submit the Issue: Once youâ€™ve filled out the information, click the "Submit new issue" button at the bottom.
